        # the consumer is recommended the product that corresponds to the highest number that their sum exceeds in model

        # then consumers with a sum between 0 and 2 will be recommended applebees, consumers with a sum between 2 and 5
        # will be recommended red lobster, and consumers with a sum of 5 and up will be recommended ruth's chris
        # (which is a fancy restaurant, just to be clear about that).
